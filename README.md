**Weather Prediction Dataset**
This repository contains a weather prediction dataset for machine learning and data analysis tasks. The dataset consists of historical weather data collected from various weather stations over a specific time period.

**Dataset Details**
The weather prediction dataset includes the following information:

**Date and Time**: The timestamp of each weather observation.
**Temperature**: The temperature recorded at each observation in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
**Humidity**: The humidity level at each observation as a percentage.
**Pressure**: The atmospheric pressure measured at each observation in hPa or mmHg.
**WindSpeed**: The wind speed recorded at each observation in miles per hour or kilometers per hour.
**Precipitation**: The amount of precipitation (rainfall, snowfall, etc.) observed during each time period.
**Weather Condition**: A categorical variable indicating the weather condition at each observation (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
**Data Format**
The dataset is provided in a structured format, typically in CSV (Comma Separated Values) or TSV (Tab Separated Values) format. Each row in the dataset represents a single weather observation, and each column corresponds to a specific attribute mentioned above (date/time, temperature, humidity, etc.).

The first row of the dataset usually contains the column headers, while subsequent rows contain the corresponding data values. Missing or unknown values may be represented as NaN (Not a Number) or null.

**Data Collection**
The weather prediction dataset is collected from reliable and publicly available sources such as meteorological organizations, weather monitoring stations, or government agencies. The data is typically collected at regular intervals (e.g., hourly, daily) and covers a specific geographical region or multiple locations.

Usage
The weather prediction dataset can be utilized for various purposes, including but not limited to:

Weather forecasting and prediction models.
Climate analysis and research.
Machine learning tasks such as regression, classification, or time series analysis.
Data visualization and exploration.
